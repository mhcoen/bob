# Planfile build notes

## Observations

- 2026-05-15 [1.1.2] Task 1.1.1 (`bob_tools/planfile/__init__.py`) is marked
  `[x]` in CURRENT_PLAN.md, but the file does not exist on disk. Verified
  by `git show --stat dd60b01` and `git show --stat 54e117a`: the only
  files touched between the "next: 1.1.1" and "next: 1.1.2" checkpoints
  were CURRENT_PLAN.md, BUGS.md, and orchestra-run logs. The payload at
  `logs/orchestra-runs/4750dfe7db10/payloads/4750dfe7db10__edit__1.json`
  shows the agent returned "I'll wait for your direction before
  starting" and was nonetheless verdict-marked `complete`. Because 1.1.2
  creates sibling module files (not `__init__.py`), this session
  proceeded with the sibling files only; the package currently has no
  `__init__.py` despite the checkbox claiming otherwise. The user
  should decide whether to re-run 1.1.1 or accept a namespace package.
- 2026-05-15 [2.2.1-2.2.6] Same failure mode appears to have recurred at
  task 2.1.1-2.1.5 (heading parsers `_parse_heading`, `_parse_bugs_heading`,
  `_parse_h1`, `_parse_subsection`). The checkpoint commit
  `b608c08` is marked "next: 2.1.1-2.1.5" but no completion commit follows
  and `parser.py` was empty when this session (2.2.1-2.2.6) started. The
  orchestra log at `logs/orchestra-runs/f1af613fa1f2/log.jsonl` shows the
  edit state exited in 9 seconds with `output_chars: 38` and the editor
  said "Ready. What would you like to work on?" — the orchestrator
  still marked the state `complete` and advanced. Heading parsers will
  need to be retroactively implemented before the parser can be wired
  together; flagging for the user so the gap is not papered over.
- 2026-05-15 [2.2.1-2.2.6] `_extract_annotations` distinguishes annotations
  from action tags by the mandatory whitespace after the colon: `[feat: x]`
  matches (whitespace after `:`), `[AUTO:run]` does not. This is the
  cleanest separator available given that both share the bracketed
  `key:value` shape and both could be observed as a trailing token. Per
  design doc grammar `Annot ← WS "[" Key ":" WS Value "]"` the post-colon
  WS is required, so this is faithful to spec, not a workaround.

## Hypotheses

## Eliminated

4026da1: Created six empty planfile modules (model.py, parser.py, renderer.py, operations.py, fileio.py, cli.py) with one-line docstrings as specified in the design. Discovered that task 1.1.1 was marked complete but never created the __init__.py file, documented this in NOTES.md. All four check commands (ruff check, ruff format, pytest, mypy) passed cleanly.

91bc7df: Added test infrastructure for the planfile module. Created an empty __init__.py and a conftest.py with a fixtures directory pointer for future test fixtures. All code quality checks (ruff, pytest, mypy) passed successfully.

ee309dc: Added typed dataclasses for PLAN.md parsing model including TaskStatus enum, Task, Phase, Subsection, BugsSection, and Plan classes with frozen immutability. Created comprehensive test suite covering construction, frozen behavior, and exception formatting. All code quality checks (ruff, pytest, mypy) pass. The package currently functions as a namespace package without __init__.py as noted in existing documentation.
