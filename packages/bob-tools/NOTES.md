# Planfile build notes

## Observations

- 2026-05-15 [1.1.2] Task 1.1.1 (`bob_tools/planfile/__init__.py`) is marked
  `[x]` in CURRENT_PLAN.md, but the file does not exist on disk. Verified
  by `git show --stat dd60b01` and `git show --stat 54e117a`: the only
  files touched between the "next: 1.1.1" and "next: 1.1.2" checkpoints
  were CURRENT_PLAN.md, BUGS.md, and orchestra-run logs. The payload at
  `logs/orchestra-runs/4750dfe7db10/payloads/4750dfe7db10__edit__1.json`
  shows the agent returned "I'll wait for your direction before
  starting" and was nonetheless verdict-marked `complete`. Because 1.1.2
  creates sibling module files (not `__init__.py`), this session
  proceeded with the sibling files only; the package currently has no
  `__init__.py` despite the checkbox claiming otherwise. The user
  should decide whether to re-run 1.1.1 or accept a namespace package.
